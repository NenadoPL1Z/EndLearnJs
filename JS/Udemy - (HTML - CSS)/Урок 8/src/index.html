      Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of
      my head in astoni
      <b
        >shment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any
        inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neith</b
      >
      er to be straying un
      <em
        >certainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or
        thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in
        the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
        When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</em
      >
      "But--what are you doing here?" And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as
      if he were spe
      <i
        >aking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please--draw me a
        sheep..." When
        <s
          >a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it
          might seem to me, a thousand miles from</s
        >
        any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a
        sheet</i
      >
      of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had
      been concentrated o
      <mark
        >n geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little
        chap (a little crossly, too)</mark
      >
      that I did not know how to draw. He answer
      <strong
        >ed me: "That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..." But I had never drawn
        a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.
        It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded
        to hear the little fellow greet it with: "No, no, no! I do not want an
        elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa co</strong
      >
      nstrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very
      cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a
      sheep. Draw me a sheep." So then I made a drawing.
